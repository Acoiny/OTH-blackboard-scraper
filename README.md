# oth-scrape-tool
Some simple python utilities to interact with the OTH-Website.

## Blackboard
Can scrape the current blackboard from the IM-Faculty of the OTH.
Will either print it to the terminal or save into a markdown file.
```bash
# print blackboard to terminal
python3 oth_tool.py black

# save into blackboard.md
python3 oth_tool.py b -m blackboard.md
```
A few aliases for `blackboard` are supported.
